Exploring sources UK river level and weather data for analysis

## River level data sources
Fairly straightforward, using the Environment Agency's [Hydrology Data Explorer](https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/explore#/landing) and it's [API](https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/doc/reference#stations-examples).  Examples

Monitoring station at Todmorden Callis Bridge has a unique id (0b5fd566-d9d1-4c66-8855-a096610cd1d1) and a page: https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/station/0b5fd566-d9d1-4c66-8855-a096610cd1d1.  15min Level (m) time series is available for download in CSV.  The API allows programmatic interaction.
